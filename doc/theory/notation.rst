Two-particle response function notation
=======================================

The notation for two-particle response functions and derived quantities such as vertex and the irreducible vertices is not settled and there are many possible notational choices. Here we establish the notation used in TPRF.

The two-particle Green's function :math:`G^{(2)}_{\bar{a}b\bar{c}d}` is defined as

.. math::

   G^{(2)}_{\bar{a}b\bar{c}d} \equiv \langle c^\dagger_{\bar{a}} c_b c^\dagger_{\bar{c}} c_d \rangle

## Version 3.1.0

TPRF version 3.1.0 is a compatibility release for TRIQS version 3.1.0 also containing some new functionality.

Eliashberg
----------
* Added functionality to solve the multi-orbital linearized Eliashberg equation for the most dominant gap functions:
    * Only irreducible particle-particle vertices dependent on one bosonic frequency and one momentum are supported.
    * Matrix product inside Eliashberg equation is implemented in two ways:
        * Explicit loops
        * Fourier transformations taking advantage of the convolution theorem
     Depending on the used meshs either implementation can be more efficient.
    * The Fourier implementation is parallelized over threads.
    * Functionality to solve for the most dominant gap function using the power method or solving for the `k` most dominant ones using the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method.
    * Functionality to only solve for gap functions with specific symmetries (frequency, momentum or orbital).
    * Added constructors for the singlet and triplet irreducible vertices in the random phase approximation.

Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE)
-----------------------------
* Added functionality to solve the BSE at specific bosonic frequencies individually to avoid memory limitations.

Chi0
----
* Added memory optimized version of chi0 construction for smaller frequency meshes.
* Added functionality to construct chi0 for specific frequency.

Contributors: Stefan KÃ¤ser, Hugo U.R. Strand

Maintenance 
-----------
* Change np.complex -> complex
* Compiler warning fixes
* Thread race-condition bugfix

TRIQS compatibility
-------------------
